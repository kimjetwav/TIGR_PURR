cifti_clean Nextflow Pipeline
==============================


Run cifti_clean_img on a set of input derivatives


USAGE

nextflow run cifti_clean.nf [options...] --derivatives <DERIVS> --out <OUT> --type (surface|volume)

DESCRIPTION

	--derivatives				Path to BIDS derivatives directory
	--out					Path to output directory
	--type					Type of derivative to use (fmriprep or ciftify)

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS (default values pre-specified)

	--simg					Which singularity image of ciftify to use 
						($simg)
	--config				Ciftify cleaning configuration file to use 
						($config)
	--help					Print usage (this message)
	--task					Parse a specific task (None)

SUPPORTED PROFILES

	-profile (kimel|scc|local)		On which system to run the cifti_clean pipeline

NOTES

Only fmriprep and ciftify derivatives are supported for cleaning. All files will be dumped into a single output directory for analysis. In addition, the cleaning configuration file used for nuisance regression will also be copied into the output folder for tracking what was used to clean the data.


The default config file which specifies default values for --simg and --config can be found in tigrlab_nextflow/nextflow_config/cifti_clean.nf.config. 

If smoothing is specified in the cleaning configuration file (--smooth-fwhm), then midthickness files from fsaverage_LR32k is used as the smoothing surface.
